Implemented a 3 tier microservices architecture. Every microservice has a database cluster attached to it. The User Session uses a Redis Cluster in with one master and two slaves. The Product Catalogue uses a MongoDB Cluster with one master and two slaves. The Shopping Cartâ€™s data persists in a 3 node Riak ring. The User Activity is stored in a 3 node Cassandra ring. For providing recommendation we are using the Neo4J graph database.
